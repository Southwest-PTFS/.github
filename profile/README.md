# 🇺🇸 Southwest PTFS • Tech

Welcome to the **Southwest PTFS Technology Organization**.  
This is our shared space to store, archive, and collaborate on the work that powers our virtual airline. Think of it as our hangar for code, configs, and experiments.

---

## What This Org Is
- A **central repo hub** for projects, prototypes, and archived tools.
- A **record of our development history** — from performance calculators to bots to infrastructure experiments.
- A **collaboration space** for SWA staff working on tech-related ideas.

## What This Org Is Not
- It’s **not a product storefront** or polished tools directory.  
- Code here is primarily for **internal use, reference, and experimentation**.  
- Not all projects are maintained or in active use.
- Any projects that are visible are open source under certain terms.
- You will not receive any support for items here unless said otherwise.
